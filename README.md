### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Max and on this profile I will put some of my projects that I have been working on. These projects cover analytical challenges that I have completed for different purposes, such as academic, self learning or for fun.

### Optimization

[Implementation of clearing mechanism of European day-ahead elictricity exchange](https://github.com/MaxH297/euphemia-implementation.git): Basic implementation of EUPHEMIA, the clearing algorithm used on the European day-ahead electricity exchange. Gurobi is used as a solver. This implementation was part of the work for my master's thesis.

### Machine Learning

[Predicting outcome of football games by looking at team's form](): Creating odds with multinomial logistic regression for football matches. Those are compared to actual odds at the time of the game provided by Bet365.

[Predicting landing success of SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket](): My result of the final capstone project of IBM Professional Data Science Certificate. Whether stage 1 of a rocket lands after a mission and can be recuperated determines financial success of entire mission. This project covers data collection through APIs and webscraping, various data visualization techniques and training different types of machine learning models.

### Miscellaneous 

[Simple stock trading bot and simulation environment](): Combines yfinance library to get live stock data with a web driver that can be used to make deals on Trading212. A simulation script allows to evaluate different trading setups based on historical stock data.
