### Enhancing Retail Flexibility Bidding in European Electricity Markets through Bid Conversion

The following repositories are associated with my paper, presented at the 20th International Conference on the European Energy Market:

[Bid Conversion Mechanism](https://github.com/MaxH297/bid-conversion-mechanism.git): Implementation of the conversion mechanism for converting demand-side flexibilities into orders that can be submitted on the European day-ahead electricity market. An exemplary implementation of a frontend can be found here: https://conversion-engine.web.app/

[Implementation of clearing mechanism of European day-ahead elictricity exchange](https://github.com/MaxH297/euphemia-implementation.git): Basic implementation of EUPHEMIA, the clearing algorithm used on the European day-ahead electricity exchange. Gurobi is used as a solver.
